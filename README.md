### description

formula for distance:

Distance of object= (Size of object * 360)/(2 * 3.14 * Angular size in degree)

### How i might do distance

size = area of object

area = w * h

initial capture get palm size and fist area

do the distance object formula

### How to do movement

use pyinput or something

### Alternative idea

use cv to control the sphero via python lib bluetooth?

Otherwise jacking the bluetooth signal from Mac and sending out other bluetooth signals to it causing it to go, stop, speed up, go to the right, go to the left, etc

### Notes

for some reason, the xml for palms does not work very well. It works mainly at a farther range. That's ok but not as practical. Fists however works in almost any circumstances. Very reliable
